We use quarterly observation on 13 variables covering the period 1987Q1-2013Q2. These include 8 variables that are standard in bayesian estimation of DSGE models: GDP, consumption, investment, inflation, wage, price of investment, hours worked and short-term risk-free rate. As CMR, we also use four financial variables: credit, slope of the term structure of interest rates, entrepreneurial networth and credit spread.
