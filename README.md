# Risk Shocks and Divergence between the Euro area and the US

Visualizing data from the estimation of DSGE model with financial frictions on the Euro area and the United States to explain the recent divergence between both economies.

Estimation and simulation of the model have been done with Dynare, we thank the Dynare Team (@DynareTeam).

The model was initially developped by Christiano L., Motto R. and Rostagno M. (2014), we thank them (and Johannsen B.) to have made their code available.

The website has been coded in R. Special thanks to :
    RStudio (@Rstudio) for shiny package,
    Hadley Wickham (@hadley) for ggplot2, reshape2, plyr and devtools
